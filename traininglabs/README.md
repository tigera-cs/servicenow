### Introduction to Labs

Lab1: Installing Calico CNI on K8S cluster.


Lab2: Understanding basics of Pod networking, IP-pool, IP address assignment to Pods.


Lab3: Understaning the working of Service in Kubernetes, exploration of Iptables chains & rules, advertising Service IP address and exposing the service using Ingress controller.


Lab4: This lab focuses on Network policy which enables/disables/partially-enable communication accross k8S endpoints.
